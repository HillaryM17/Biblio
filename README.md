# Biblio

We created this website to provide a place for a user to find pronunciation and definition of a word as well as examples of how to use the word in other context's.

### Usage 

In order to use the website the user will enter their desired word into the search bar, this will then provide the user with relevant definitions, examples and a pronunciation audio. 
The user will be able to see their previous search history in the side bar, and will be able to navigate into the words by clicking on them. The user will also be able to remove from the local storage by pressing the small "x" inside each button. 

### Acceptance Criteria 

* With your team, you'll conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. You'll also learn about agile development methodologies to help you work collaboratively. You'll implement feature and bug fixes using Git branch workflow and pull requests.

* You'll write your own user stories and acceptance criteria in GitHub Issues to help your team stay on track with the project. Using GitHub Project to track the status of your project tasks will help you understand the benefits of Kanban boards.

* You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:

   * Use Bootstrap.

    * Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

    * Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).

    * Use at least two server-side APIs 

* Links to an external site..

* Use modals instead of alerts, confirms, or prompts.

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on).

* Have a quality README (including a unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to the deployed application).
