## Usage 

In order to use the website the user will enter their desired word into the search bar, this will then provide the user with relevant definitions, examples and a pronunciation audio. 
The user will be able to see their previous search history in the side bar, and will be able to navigate into the words by clicking on them. The user will also be able to remove from the local storage by pressing the small "x" inside each button.
